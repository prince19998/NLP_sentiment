Design and implement a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras for sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie reviews (e.g., IMDB dataset). Perform the following steps: 

1. Preprocess the text data. 

2. Tokenize and pad the sequences. 

3. Build an LSTM or GRU model. 

4. Train the model and evaluate its performance.
